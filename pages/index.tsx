Sure, let's initialize a basic Next.js project structure by creating a main page (index.tsx) with a simple task tracker layout.

```typescript
/**
 * @file This is the main entry page for the Next.js task tracker project.
 *
 * @purpose This file sets up the initial project structure for a basic task tracker application.
 * The layout includes a header, a section for displaying tasks, and a footer.
 *
 * @functions 
 * - TaskTracker: The functional component for the task tracker. Displays the main content.
 *
 * @returns The main page of the task tracker application.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This is a simple setup starter for the Next.js project. More components and features 
 * such as task creation, editing, and state management will be added in subsequent steps.
 */

import React from 'react'

/**
 * @component TaskTracker
 * @description Main functional component for rendering the initial page layout.
 *              Includes a header, task display section, and a footer.
 */
const TaskTracker: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <h1>Task Tracker</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        <h2>Your Tasks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Task 1</li>
          <li>Task 2</li>
          <li>Task 3</li>
        </ul>
      </main>
      <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 Task Tracker</p>
      </footer>
    </div>
  )
}

export default TaskTracker
```

Explanation:
- The file begins with a detailed documentary comment explaining its purpose, functions, and return values.
- We import React, which is necessary to use JSX.
- A functional component `TaskTracker` is created to form the basic structure of the main page.
- The main layout includes a header, a section to display tasks, and a footer.
- The component is exported as the default export of the file.
